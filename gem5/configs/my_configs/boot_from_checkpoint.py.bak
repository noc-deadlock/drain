""" Script to boot from checkpoint and run ROI in detailed mode
    When this script is run without the --script parameter, gem5 will boot
    Linux and sit at the command line, assuming this is how your disk is
    configured. With the script parameter, the script will be executed on the
    guest system.
    The system is first restored with the atomic model for the cores and then
    switches to a more detailed model (DerivO3CPU) after reaching ROI.
    After the ROI it switches to the simple timing model only because
    I couldn't get it to work with the atomic one.
